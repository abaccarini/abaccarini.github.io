Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 5th year computer sicence PhD candidate under the supervision of [Dr. Marina Blanton](https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~mblanton/) at the University at Buffalo.

My interests broadly encopmass information security, applied cryptography, and privacy enhancing technologies.

Specifically, I design protocols for secure multi-party computation. 
synthesizing many various research domains in order to devise highly performant solutions.

In conjunction with this work, I'm the primary developer on *[PICCO](https://github.com/applied-crypto-lab/picco/)*, a srouce-to-source compiler to translate general purpose programs into a secure variant for deployment in a distributed setting. This involves optimizing existing protocol implementations, while simultaneously developing new ones.

The second area of interest is researching the suitability from an information-theoretic perspective.  

Prior to starting my PhD, I earned my masters in Cybersecurity from Fordham University, where I also obtained my bachelors in Physics.


When I'm not doing science, I'm probably spending way too much time tweaking my Neovim config -- check out my [dotfiles here](https://github.com/abaccarini/dotfiles)!
