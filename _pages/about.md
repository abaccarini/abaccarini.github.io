Hi, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a 5th year computer science PhD candidate under the supervision of [Dr. Marina Blanton](https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~mblanton/) at the University at Buffalo. My interests span across areas of information security, applied cryptography, and privacy enhancing technologies.

Concretely, I design protocols for secure multi-party computation based on secret sharing with a wide range of applications, such as privacy-preserving machine learning, sustainability, and outsourcing. This requires synthesizing various research domains to build highly performant solutions.

In conjunction with this work, I'm the primary maintainer of [PICCO](https://github.com/applied-crypto-lab/picco/), an open-source compiler that translates general purpose programs into their secure variants for deployment in a distributed setting. I'm frequently optimizing existing protocol source code, while concurrently developing implementaitons for new techniques.

<!-- The second area of interest is researching private information disclosure from secure function evaluation from an information-theoretic perspective. -->

Prior to starting my PhD, I earned my masters in Cybersecurity from Fordham University, where I also obtained my bachelors in Physics.

When I'm not doing science, I'm probably spending way too much time tweaking my Neovim config -- check out my [dotfiles here](https://github.com/abaccarini/dotfiles)!
