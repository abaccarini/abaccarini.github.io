Hi, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am the principal consultant at [Guardian Cryptography](https://www.guardiancryptography.com/) and a [security researcher](/publications) specializing in information security, applied cryptography, and privacy enhancing technologies.

<!-- My interests span across areas of information security, applied cryptography, and privacy-enhancing technologies.  -->

Examples of my work include designing and implementing protocols for secure multi-party computation (MPC), and quantifying information disclosure from secure computation through information-theoretic approaches. I also co-maintain [PICCO](https://github.com/applied-crypto-lab/picco/), an open-source MPC compiler and library.

<!-- with application to -->
<!-- privacy-preserving machine learning, sustainability, and outsourcing. -->
<!-- based on secret sharing for a variety of practical applications, such as  -->
<!-- Additionally, I research how to  -->
<!-- arbitrary secure function evaluations  -->

<!-- for translating general-purpose programs into their secure equivalents for distributed deployment. -->

<!-- Concretely, I design protocols for secure multi-party computation based on secret sharing for a variety of applications, such as privacy-preserving machine learning, sustainability, and outsourcing.  -->
<!-- I'm often writing new protocol implementations, optimizing existing protocols, and improving overall usability. -->
<!-- Additionally, I research how to quantify information disclosure from arbitrary secure function evaluations through information-theoretic approaches. -->
<!-- My second area of interest involves quantifying (and subsequently, lowering) information disclosure from secure function evaluations.  -->
<!-- This work touches several disciplines, including information theory, differential privacy, and quantitative information flow. -->

I earned my PhD in computer science from the University at Buffalo, where I was advised by [Marina Blanton](https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~mblanton/).

<!-- I previously obtained my masters in Cybersecurity and bachelors in Physics from Fordham University. -->

<!-- When I'm not doing science, I'm probably spending way too much time tweaking my Neovim config -- check out my [dotfiles here](https://github.com/abaccarini/dotfiles)! -->
