### 💼 **What I Offer**  

I provide expert consulting services focused on the design, analysis, and auditing of cryptographic systems. With a PhD in Computer Science and deep research and engineering experience across privacy-enhancing technologies, secure computation, and protocol design, I help teams build secure and efficient cryptographic software, identify weaknesses, and future-proof their systems.

### 🛠️ **Core Services** 

> #### **Cryptographic Protocol Review & Auditing** 📝
> I offer both formal and informal audits of cryptographic protocols, covering threshold cryptography, secure multi-party computation (MPC), fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), differential Privacy, zero-knowledge (ZK) systems. My process includes validating design correctness, scrutinizing security proofs, and analyzing cryptographic assumptions. I also conduct adversarial threat modeling and assess leakage in complex environments.

> #### **Secure Software Code Audits** 🔎
> I perform detailed code reviews for cryptographic implementations written in C++, Rust, Python, Solidity, and domain-specific libraries. These audits include analysis of side-channel vulnerabilities, potential information leakage, and comprehensive static and dynamic testing tailored specifically to cryptographic software.

> #### **Architecture & Design Consulting** 📐 
> I assist clients in designing new cryptographic or privacy-preserving systems from the ground up. This includes end-to-end architecture reviews for blockchain, machine learning, and fintech platforms. I also advise on integrating advanced primitives (e.g., MPC, threshold FHE, or ring-based protocols) into production-ready infrastructure.

> #### **Research & Strategy Advisory** 🔬
> I support clients with high-level technical guidance, including whitepaper reviews, technical due diligence for startups, and advisory services for investors assessing cryptographic risks. I also offer research-oriented support, such as prototyping cutting-edge cryptographic constructions and producing benchmarking data suitable for academic or whitepaper publication.
